````bash
$ sudo ./reset.sh
````
## The first run!
Jira Datacenter need to conf on only one node first.
To startup, try to use the script:
````bash
$ sudo ./firstrun.sh
````
And follow the info in this script...

When you are up on all nodes, you will be able to access jira like this:
http://jira.internal
